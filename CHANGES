    Sketch out data structure for packet buffer

    Implement advance function for packet buffer.

    Implement process fragment function for packet buffer.

    Sketch out function to split packet into fragments

    Sketch out code to process incoming packets and pass them to the packet buffer.

    Sketch out code to get packets from packet buffer in one loop


November 30th, 2015
===================

    Make sure all serialize functions are getting called from test.cpp

    Add premake file for clean, make all etc. annoying to manually delete bins before checking in.

    Fix a bunch of bullshit with dev environment being broken by el capitan

    Get building with maximum warning levels on clang.

    Fix compiler warnings in release build (check macro needs to not be assert)

    Make sure it builds and works in release and debug builds.

    Clean up test to consolidate the context into the one test_stream function.


November 29th, 2015
===================

    Convert stream errors to PROTOCOL2_ERROR_* form and add to error_string fn.

    Fix GCC specific stuff (eg. __builtin_bswap etc)

    Make sure stream properly handles overflow on read. On write, stream should assert (it's your fault!)

    Split rest of existing template serialize fns to serialize_x_internal and wrap with macros for return false.

    Move the packet factory into implementation section.

    Make a list of all serialize functions to test.

        1. serialize_int
        2. serialize_bits
        3. serialize_bool
        4. serialize_float
        5. serialize_uint64
        6. serialize_double
        7. serialize_bytes
        8. serialize_string
        9. serialize_align
        10. serialize_check
        11. serialize_object


November 25th, 2015
===================

    Fixed weird serialization error.

    Make sure code doesn't blow up if only one packet is defined.

    Handle the protocol id in the checksum calculation, eg. pre-header

    Add code to get strings for various enums (especially error codes)

    Add comparison operators (==) to test packet types.

    Verify the packets received match the packet data sent.


October 21st, 2015
==================

    Implement unit tests

    Sketched out packet read/write for article 001

    Added concept of multiple errors: overflow, invalid, abort

    GetError() returns 0 if no error (PROTOCOL2_STREAM_ERROR_NONE)

    Make SerializeInteger return true/false on success/failure again

    Update macros to return false on failure

    Make sure there is not double checking for overflow (stream and bit reader etc.)

    Find public domain CRC32 implementation

    Clean up the CRC impl.

    Write functions to calculate packet CRC

    Move read and write packet into protocol2.h (generally useful)

    Split apart protocol2.h into implementation and header, STB style.

    Add enum for packet read error. Packet write error can only have one cause (serialize write failure), and you can already check it on the stream.

    Add more interesting serialization examples to make up the packets, eg. an array of things, a string, some byte data, position/velocity with at rest flag.

    Randomize the data sent in the packets

    Add prints showing the numbers of bytes in packets

    Added serialize_float (uncompressed)
