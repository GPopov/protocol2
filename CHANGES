CHANGES

21st October 2015
=================

    Implement unit tests

    Sketched out packet read/write for article 001

    Added concept of multiple errors: overflow, invalid, abort

    GetError() returns 0 if no error (PROTOCOL2_STREAM_ERROR_NONE)

    Make SerializeInteger return true/false on success/failure again

    Update macros to return false on failure

    Make sure there is not double checking for overflow (stream and bit reader etc.)

    Find public domain CRC32 implementation

    Clean up the CRC impl.

    Write functions to calculate packet CRC

    Move read and write packet into protocol2.h (generally useful)

    Split apart protocol2.h into implementation and header, STB style.

    Add enum for packet read error. Packet write error can only have one cause (serialize write failure), and you can already check it on the stream.

    Add more interesting serialization examples to make up the packets, eg. an array of things, a string, some byte data, position/velocity with at rest flag.

    Randomize the data sent in the packets

    Add prints showing the numbers of bytes in packets

    Added serialize_float (uncompressed)
