DONE

TODO

    Implementation work todo on chunk sender:

        a) if the receiver stalls out in a chunk receive, it should count as a timeout (set a reasonable time for them to receive the chunk),
           otherwise the reciever can hang the protocol? or not. maybe for the blocks as part of the reliable message stream...

        b) burst mode

        c) bandwidth limiting

    These things should be done for the pro version at the end of the article series, when everything is brought together into one protocol.






    =======================================

    This code is so messed up in Visual C++, it's probably a good idea to port the networked physics demo there as well.

    People are looking at that code, but very few must be able to run it.

    The code has much more value if you can actually run it and play around!

    =======================================
           Reliable Packets over UDP
    =======================================

    Actually hook the example code up to the functions in node and make sure the interface matches what I expect.

    Basically here I want to verify that all reliable packets are received reliably and in order, and to process (throw away)
    the unreliable packets (make sure at least one gets through)

    Need to setup the simulator.

    Need to setup the function to serialize packet.
