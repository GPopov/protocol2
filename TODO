DONE

    serialize_check with a uint32_t passed in was annoying.

    Changed it to pass in a string which is hashed, this way you can print out cool stuff like which check failed.

    Which is very helpful for debugging...

TODO

    I suspect I need to clear out the memory after the decrypt. It's extra bits getting fed into the bitpacker at the end from encryption!
