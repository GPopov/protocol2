    Setup packet send and receive loop

    Randomize the length of chunks and the data inside each chunk

    Get n chunks being sent and received, making sure the received data matches the sent data (and the # of bytes matches)

    Consider integrating network simulator into the protocol2.h (generally useful?)

    ==================

    Integrate network simulator into example, because without handling packet loss, out of order, dup etc. this code is not guaranteed to be working

    Perhaps network simulator belongs in protocol2.h

    I would say yes. Lots of different examples are going to need this functionality.

    ==================

    Once example source has good logs, handles packet loss and latency, out of order, etc (soak) then it is ready to publish.

    Example code must have a soak mode, eg. set num iterations to -1

    Verify the soak mode runs indefinitely

    Ready to upload to supporters! :D
