DONE

    Went back over all previous examples and added soak behavior.

    Soaking is essential to guarantee correct behavior. Passes.

TODO

    Port to linux (linode box)

    Port to windows




    =======================================
           Reliable Packets over UDP
    =======================================

    Actually hook the example code up to the functions in node and make sure the interface matches what I expect.

    Basically here I want to verify that all reliable packets are received reliably and in order, and to process (throw away)
    the unreliable packets (make sure at least one gets through)

    Need to setup the simulator.

    Need to setup the function to serialize packet.
