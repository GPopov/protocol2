DONE

    Now that it reproduces with the basically rewritten packet processor, the question is -- can it be reproduced on linux, in a test case?

    Try again, with the actual packet processor sending packets.

    If it reproduces, then the reproduction can be cut down to isolate the problem.

    If it doesn't reproduce, then I still suspect something bad, eg. mem trashing, or queues or something bad trashing memory.

TODO
    
    Strip down into a test case.
