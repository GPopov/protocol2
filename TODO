DONE

    Almost finished with converting network interface across.

    It's going well. I like the new library idea, and it adds a lot of value for clients vs. a bunch of sample code.

    Need to track down some memory leaks. I'm really not sure why I'm getting them...

    Fixed. Just needed to keep local.

TODO

    Now need to finishing bringing across network interface and then flesh out the actual client/server.
