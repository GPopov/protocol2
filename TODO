    Bring across a simple connection example without any external dependencies.

    So far brought across message, message factory, connection packet, connection configuration (as constants).

    Connection implemented ported and cleaned up.

    Now need to bring across the code for soak testing connection messages.

    For the moment, don't actually serialize the messages.

    But once it is working without serialization, implement that using the functions from "004_sending_large_blocks_of_data.cpp" to send and receive packets via simulator. It's important to actualy demonstrate serialization and packet drops, in a straightforward way.

    Hacked up a basic reliable message soak test. It works under 99% packet loss for a while, but then message send keeps moving forward (slowly), but messages stop getting received.

    This looks like a breakage. What is going on, and why wasn't it picked up in the message system inside yojimbo testing?







    ---------------

    Simplify the packet encryption example so it is more self contained, eg. use the same private key on both sides. Keep it simple.

    Cleanup and remove memory initialize and the stupid allocator stuff. There is no need for any of this.

    Remove the queue and data structures I'm not using.

    Remove the securing dedicated servers example. Yojimbo is this example but has moved on. This code is old and has bugs. Can't reasonably maintain two versions of libyojimbo just for a single example program.
