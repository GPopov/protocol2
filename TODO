    =======================================

    This code is so messed up in Visual C++, it's probably a good idea to port the networked physics demo there as well.

    People are looking at that code, but very few must be able to run it.

    The code has much more value if you can actually run it and play around!

    Also, convert this code over to BSD 3.0 and premake5 at the same time
