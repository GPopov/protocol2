DONE

    Serialize check is still failing for the ack and slice packet read/write. WTF

    Was incorrectly deleting packet data pointer before returning to caller.

    Implement latency.

    Implement packet loss.

    Make sure the 003 example runs correctly with simulator now (latency only)

    Of course now that packet loss is enabled, it is broken. Obviously some logic problem in the acks.

TODO

    Get 003 example running under packet loss.

    Soak it. Make sure it soaks forever with packet loss.

    ==================

    Implement jitter.

    Implement duplicates.

    ==================

    Verify the soak mode runs indefinitely with simulated out of order, packet loss, latency etc.

    Ready to upload to supporters! :D

    ==================

    Need to go back over both 001 and 002 examples and add soak modes.

    Soaking is essential to guarantee correct behavior.

    ==================
