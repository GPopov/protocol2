DONE

    Extend simulator to take address with packet send and receive.

    Need both to and from addresses per-packet queued in simulator. Added.

    Convert over the network simulator to work from raw packet data and size vs. packet structure

    Fix bugs in the network simulator causing it to loop forever when receiving packets.
    (was not clearing the entry on receive)

    Put random_int, random_float inside network2.h header. Needed for simulator.

    Update 003 example to have an address for sender and receiver (::1 with different port numbers)

    Implement function to send packet, eg. write it to data and then send it via simulator

    Loop to read packets from simulator. If packet is received, read it and then take the packet
    and work out from packet type how it should be processed, eg. slice packet -> receiver,
    ack packet -> sender.

TODO

    There is a bug that looks like truncated packets on read. The last serialize check is failing.

    This is the first time that I've actually passed in the bytes written on read? I think?

    If so this could be the source of the error. I'm not doing anything crazy.

    ==================

    Implement packet loss.

    Implement latency.

    Implement jitter.

    Implement duplicates.

    ==================

    Verify the soak mode runs indefinitely with simulated out of order, packet loss, latency etc.

    Ready to upload to supporters! :D
