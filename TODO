DONE

TODO

    Need to go back over 001 and 002 examples and add soak modes.

    Soaking is essential to guarantee correct behavior.

    Add more unit tests for protocol2 behavior, there was a bug in serialize_bytes for small buffer sizes and I missed it.

    There are probably more!

    This is a good way to get back into the swing of coding on this stuff.

    Also, port to windows. Compile and run and test everything on there. You have a windows box. Use it!

    Also, run on linux and make sure it compiles there as well. GCC etc. Build it on my linode box.



    ==================

    Actually hook the example code up to the functions in node and make sure the interface matches what I expect.

    Basically here I want to verify that all reliable packets are received reliably and in order, and to process (throw away)
    the unreliable packets (make sure at least one gets through)

    Need to setup the simulator.

    Need to setup the function to serialize packet.
