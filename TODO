DONE

    Rebuild the client/server example without requiring complicated shit like network interface

    eg. send packets directly over an actual socket, use the socket buffer as the queue.

    There is example code for doing exactly this in one example already written.

    I think the client and server need their own sockets though.

    Yes. Progressing well. All I need now is an implementation for the send and receive packet functions.

TODO

    Implement SendPacket function

    Implement ReceivePacket function

    -------------

    Add a BUILDING.md

    People should know how to build this when they get it.

    -------------

    Now extend the reliable messages example to also including sending large blocks for the next example.

    -------------

    Packet compression example source code would be a great way to explore it, also self-contained.
