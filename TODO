DONE

TODO

    Now I need to actually implement the send and receive queues for the socket interface.

    What data structures do I need for this? I may need to bring more data structures across, eg. queue, array, hash, sliding window etc.

    To be fair, I probably need to do this ANYWAY

    Yes, definitely needs queue, so bring across all the data structures.

    Looks like we're moving away from header style libraries... =p
