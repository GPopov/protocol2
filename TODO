DONE

TODO

    Now I need to actually implement the send and receive queues for the socket interface.

    Need to bring across the various data structures I was relying on

    eg. queue at minimum, array, also hash. Should switch over the challenge has to use that.

    Also may need to bring across allocators.

    I think the only allocation performed in protocol2 or network2 is in the packet factory,
    and this can easily be overridden with a virtual allocate function possibly?

    Don't put a heavyweight allocator system inside the protocol2, but instead simple callbacks
    and/or virtual functions to override to perform allocation for packets?
