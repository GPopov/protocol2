DONE

TODO

    I'm pretty sure the block code doesn't work with out of order yet.

    I also found a bugs in the serialize function which wasn't getting called for the connection packet. Both 006 and 007.

    To fix this I really need to actually serialize connection packets and put them through the packet simulator.

    Do this, and then try to break the examples. This is important.

    Also need to add the code to check that the block size and contents validate.

    Add a BUILDING.md

    People should know how to build this when they get it.

    Ship it. Go back to writing articles. You're done with R&D for a while.
