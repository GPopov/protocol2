DONE

    Extend simulator to take address with packet send and receive.

    Need both to and from addresses per-packet queued in simulator. Added.

TODO

    ===================

    Convert over the network simulator to work from raw packet data and size vs. packet structure

    Update 003 example to have an address for sender and receiver (::1 with different port numbers)

    Implement function to send packet, eg. write it to data and then send it via simulator

    Loop to read packets from simulator. If packet is received, read it and then take the packet
    and work out from packet type how it should be processed, eg. slice packet -> receiver,
    ack packet -> sender.

    Fix bugs in the network simulator causing it to loop forever when receiving packets.

    Put random_int, random_float inside network2.h header. Needed for simulator.

    Implement packet loss.

    Implement latency.

    Implement jitter.

    Implement duplicates.

    ==================

    Verify the soak mode runs indefinitely with simulated out of order, packet loss, latency etc.

    Ready to upload to supporters! :D
