DONE

    Hacked up a really simple data structure. Not implement

    Add counters to print out at the end of the packet encryption test

    Make sure everything is working OK

    Seems fine.

    Fix the salt timeout it's broken

    Search through additional todos. Seems fine. Added some more notes.

    Specifically, I want a way to genericalyl abort packet read at the TYPE level, if that type is not allowed for some reason.

TODO

    eg. a type that the server doesn't expect, *or* an unencrypted packet for a type that should be encrypted and so on.

    This part is probably important to do before saying the packet encryption part is finished, because that's a key part of being secure.

    Don't let the client just get in under the covers with an unencrypted packet!

    Doing this now...

    Package up something for supporters this month. It should make them happy, but be low key about it.
