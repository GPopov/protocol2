DONE

    Seems like I have more work to do, for example if I want the prefix bytes to be considered as part of the crc32
    this is going to suck ass.

    Seeing as where it really counts, I'm going to be using encryption instead of CRC32, fuck it, don't include prefix bytes in crc32.

    OK done.

    Next, setup the network interface to write in raw format if encrypted, and stick the packet flag into the prefix byte.

    Alright. Now we know if a packet is encrypted on not based on the flags in the first byte.

TODO

    Now rework the encryption so that it uses that first byte as the additional data. It needs to be signed!
