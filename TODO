DONE

    Finally finished the encoding of the variable length uint64_t sequence #

    Added code to stick the top bit to 1 in encrypted packets, and check this on packet read to know what to do.

    Now to hook up the packet to encode the sequence # in the prefix byte and the end of the packet.

    Had to disable stream check that no bits are left in packet to serialize for this to work.

    Verify this writes and reads back properly. Only do it for encrypted mode.

    Once this passes, extend to actually perform the encryption, eg. copy across to another buffer.

TODO

    Having some weird desync with the decryption refusing to work.

    Why don't I just have a variable # of prefix bytes. It so much simple than what I'm currently doing.
