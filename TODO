TODO

    Now to actually design the packet format for the encryption packet

    I think there needs to be an initial byte that tells you how to handle the packet

    The initial byte needs to have the packet type, no question.

    Because certain packet types will be encrypted and others will not be.

    The packet factory needs to know which packets are encrypted on a per-type basis.

    Protocol2 should be able to build without security if it is desired, so #if PROTOCOL_SECURE is necessary.
