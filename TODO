DONE

TODO

    Things to do to move forward:

        Research HMAC.

        Find a bcrypt implementation to use in C.

        Also need a high quality random number implementation for the salt.

        Need to pick a backend language.

        Need to work out what HTTPS library I use for my dedis and client to communicate with the matcher service.

        Implement a non-secure version of the client/server protocol as a starting point.

        This is important for analysis, to show how it can be attacked at a protocol level (not even really DDoS)






    =======================================

    This code is so messed up in Visual C++, it's probably a good idea to port the networked physics demo there as well.

    People are looking at that code, but very few must be able to run it.

    The code has much more value if you can actually run it and play around!

    Also, convert this code over to BSD 3.0 and premake5 at the same time
