DONE

    Example code must have a soak mode, eg. set num iterations to -1

    Verify soak runs for a significant time with perfect network conditions.

    Sketched out new interface for network simulator. Previous GDC 2015 network simulator too complicated for what I want to do.

    Added interface for packet loss, duplicates, jitter and latency.

TODO

    Implement a really basic network simulator that works without any packet loss, delay, dupes, etc.
            
    ==================

    Integrate network simulator into example, because without handling packet loss, out of order, dup etc. this code is not guaranteed to be working

    Perhaps network simulator belongs in protocol2.h

    I would say yes. Lots of different examples are going to need this functionality.

    ==================

    Implementing functionality to duplicate packets could be difficult.

    ==================

    Verify the soak mode runs indefinitely with simulated out of order, packet loss, latency etc.

    Ready to upload to supporters! :D
