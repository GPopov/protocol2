    Get it working across MacOSX, Linux, Windows.

    On linux the challenge token inside the encrypted packet is getting corrupted somehow.

    Confirm that the challenge token is basically getting corrupted. The client receives it fucked up.

    I think there are bugs in libsodium on this platform. I am certain I am using it incorrectly.

    Is this another case of decryption not working on linux unless it's aligned properly? I think this is a compiler bug or a bug in sodium.

    Worth testing on windows now. If it corrupts on windows it's probably my fault.

    It won't though, which means it's linux's fault. Hah. =p

    Yes. Works fine on linux. I'm blaming my linux distribution + GCC. Upgrade?

    No dice. It's debian 8.4, which is the latest stable. Can't blame the linux like that.

    What about GCC? Is it a GCC specific bug or issue?

TODO

    Once it's working everywhere, copy across to 009_basic_matchmaking.cpp and strip down the matcher to have less stuff in it in 008_*.cpp
