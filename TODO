DONE

    Now I really need to get a network interface going, some way to send and receive packets.

    In my previous implementation the actual serialization of the messages was performed later,
    eg. they were added to a queue.

    How about implementing a network interface implementation inside the example program first,
    and then seeing how it can be generalized into the library? (this is a good general pattern...)

    How about just getting the basic BSD sockets implementation into the network2.h?

    Halfway through this.

TODO

    Need to bring across the actual internel send and receive functions for the socket class.

    Then once this is done, can bring across an actual send queue or something like that.

    Key design goal here is to keep the protocol2 aspect of packets separate from the over the wire sending.

    This probably means that packets and send queues *and* serialization need to belong in protocol2

    While the actual gritty of sending that over the wire and receiving over the wire belongs in network2
