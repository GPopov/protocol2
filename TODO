TODO

    -------------

    Rebuild the client/server example without requiring complicated shit like network interface

    -------------

    Add a BUILDING.md

    People should know how to build this when they get it.

    -------------

    Now extend the reliable messages example to also including sending large blocks for the next example.

    -------------

    Packet compression example source code would be a great way to explore it, also self-contained.
