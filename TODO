    Almost finished function to split packets apart into fragment packets

    Convert remaining comment pseudocode into code for the split packet function.

    Added "Header" protocol object which provides an in for the user creating their own header for packets.

TODO

    Implement packet header object and pass it in to the 002_* example source code.

    Packet header should include:

        + uint16_t sequence

    Going to need a function to swap uint16_t to network, back to host order etc.

    ===========================

    Whoops, forgot to add packet sequence, fragmentId and totalFragments to fragment packet header.

    Need to add these in for 002, but while for 001, there is really no need. Optional header. Leave to article 2.

    ===========================
    
    Work out what function is required to actually process packet fragment, eg. actually read in the 
    packet, look at the packet type, and add the packet where appropriate.

    Store fragment (without header) in packet buffer.

    Therefore, we can pass in regular packets, as well as actual fragments, they'll just get combined nicely.

    ==========================================

    Get started on packets split up.

    Design: 16 bit packet sequence, 8 bit chunk id, 8 bit num chunks for this packet.

    Make sure to implement an align after the packet type if 0 type, so the rest of the packet
    and the packet data can align nicely and be read without bit seeking.

    Need to include length of packet fragment? No. It can be inferred because the packet header
    for a fragment being a known number of bytes. Saves 16bits minimum (fragments are > 8bits in length)

    What data structure is required to handle it on the receiver side?

    What data structure is required to send on the sender side? (just send all at once? Yes, do this = simplest.)

    Data structure, array of 256 pointers for each entry in sliding window data structure.

    Each sliding window structure is:

        + 16 bit packet sequence
        + num sequence for packet
        + total fragments for this packet
        + num fragments received so far
        + array of 256 pointers to the fragment data

    How to efficiently free old fragments? Ideally walk over old fragments older than 
    oldest sequence to be considered, free all fragments and then clear sequence entry.

    This article then would double as a good introduction also to the data structure
    of the sequence array as a useful data structure for network programming.

    Trick: Reserve packet type 0 as "fragment". When writing packet fragment,
    use same basic format, eg. protocol id fake prefix, crc32, packet type,

    BUT if the packet type is zero, then packet fragment information follows.

    Otherwise, throw the packet through the existing packet 

    Voila: packet fragmentation and re-assembly with overhead for non-fragmented packets of 1/64th of a bit.

    Should packet fragmentation and reassembly be built in to the protocol2.h?

    I don't think so. It will add complicated data structures, and the existing read/write packet
    function can be worked around, eg. with dummy packet 0 to get the effect desired for the second
    article.

    Seems important to make a token effort to deliver buffered packets in sequence number order,
    so I think all packets, even if one fragment should go through the buffer.

    Consider, how can a malicious sender mess up the packet fragment buffer on receive? 

     + They could rapidly advance the packet sequence forward so existing packets are buffered, 
       but this would just stop packets getting through give no benefit to the attacker. Don't worry about that.
     + They could try to go outside bounds of what could be buffered, eg. send fragment 99 for a buffered packet with only 10 fragments.
     + All fragment values must be rigorously checked, if any value doesn't make sense or is out of bounds, discard the packet.
     + They could flood the server with maximum size packets, causing worst case memory allocation for their client, 
     + To handle this put a limit on the maximum # of packet fragments to buffer per-client
     + If the client hast that number of packet fragments in their buffer already, just discard the fragment.
     + This lets you set a more reasonable worst case, eg. 1024 fragments max = 1mb per-client worst case
       vs. 256 * 256 * 1024 = 256mb worst case if you don't implement this limit. Ouch. (32 clients = 8gig... = server crash)
     + This works well provided you can work out the number of packet fragments that are required under average conditions.
     + This depends on the depth of your packet buffer, as well as the average size of packets, eg. how many fragments per-packet on average.
     + Also, remember you don't need to buffer packets once they are received, but a malicious attacker could send packets with 256 packets,
       and then only send you 255 fragments, giving you worst case behavior. So you need to handle this.

    Perform analysis of how packet loss affects the packets you receive, as the number of fragments per-packet increases.

    Conclusion. Packet fragmentation and re-assembly amplifies packet loss as the number of fragments per-packet increases.

    Bursty packet loss vs. random loss % per-packet. Do some research as to how it looks online.

    If the packet loss is typically bursty anyway then it's going to clump together moreso than truly random chance per-packet of loss.

    Weakness of current implementation:

     - extra packet copies?

    But in multiplayer games, especially on dedicated servers, packets are infrequent enough (n times per-second, per-client)
    that packet copies are not a significant overhead in practice (for higher throughput packets like web servers servicing
    millions of requests per-second, may be another story.)
