DONE

    Implement the main loop of 004 using the provided interfaces before actually implementing the functions.

    This will let me know if the interfaces make sense or suck.

    At minimum, going to need to adjust how the packet headers are passed in to read aggregate packet, and how read packets
    are returned from that function to caller.

    Implement write aggregate packet function

    Setup code to read the aggregate packet

    Read aggregate packet is mismatching on the crc32. What's going on?!

    Was just passing the wrong number of bytes to read. MaxPacketSize instead of bytesWritten. Fixed.

    Iterate across the read packets to make sure it's all good and works.

TODO

    No. There is a strange desync where bits are left over, and reading back packets seem to be occasionally 1 byte less than written.

    Probably some strange thing caused by writing packets piecemeal and copying over, vs. all at once in the stream, BUT...

    It's annoying, and needs to be fixed.
    
    ==================

    Add packet headers to the mix

    Verify packet headers write OK as well.

    ==================

    Update reading and writing packets article with a good reason why big endian is used for network order [x][0][0][0] vs. [0][0][0][x]

    Make note about copying or at least clearing to zeros after you write a packet so you don't accidentally truncate the packet and not notice.

    Need to go back over both 001 and 002 examples and add soak modes.

    Soaking is essential to guarantee correct behavior.
