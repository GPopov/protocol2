TODO
   
    Next step for work. Strip out the encryption mapping and it it in its own class.

    Implement the encryption mapping properly.

    Test the encryption mapping.

    Next, implement a queue and stop using the stupid memory allocator and types from those idiots. Update LICENCE.

    Now copy across to 009_basic_matchmaking.cpp and clean 008.
