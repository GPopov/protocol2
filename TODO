DONE

    Get it working across MacOSX, Linux, Windows.

TODO

    On linux the challenge token inside the encrypted packet is getting corrupted somehow.

    Is this another case of decryption not working on linux unless it's aligned properly? I think this is a compiler bug...

    Once it's working everywhere, copy across to 009_basic_matchmaking.cpp and strip down the matcher to have less stuff in it in 008_*.cpp
