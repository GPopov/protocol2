DONE

    Check through definitions in protocol2.h, network2.h -- are there things in there that can be removed?

TODO

    Remove fat packet processor test from test.cpp

    Turn the CRC32 back on so until the libsodium bug is fixed, it picks it up. Put a note in there.

    Make sure everything works with YOJIMBO_SECURE disabled again.

    Add error reporting to packet processor so I have enough information to reconstruct counters.
   
    Make sure all tests work.
