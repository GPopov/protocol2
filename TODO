TODO
    
    Bring across client/server code, but review it as it's brought across and convert the packets from stupid_c_case to camelCaseStyle for uniformity.

    Get one client sending a connection request (from the matcher)

    Call the client connect "SecureConnect" so it can co-exist with the normal connection in the eventual Yojimbo lib.
