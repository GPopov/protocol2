    Create network2.h

    Also low-level sockets, and IPv6 address from GDC 2015 source code.

    Do not allow any dependencies between protocol2.h and network2.h

    Add the simulator to the network library, but don't have it store the packet pointer.

    It must store the actual packet data (dynamically allocated), serialization belongs in protocol2.h

    This way I now have two generally useful one file libraries and protocol2.h doesn't end up with a shitty
    simulator that has no concept of network address.

    ==================

    Verify the soak mode runs indefinitely with simulated out of order, packet loss, latency etc.

    Ready to upload to supporters! :D
