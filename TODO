    Port to windows.

    How to get git going under win64?

    Need to also install premake for windows.

    Wow... there are a lot of issues...

    Bunch of problems with winsock...

    Ignoring winsock for now. Disabling network aspects...

    Fixing a bunch of compile errors, switch to alloca...

    002 example hangs... (WHY?!!!)

    Had to disable some warnings, simply no way to get around.

    Runtime errors can happen on truncation of int, eg. bits set in high. Crazy!

    Port back to MacOSX...

    Unix doesn't like #include <malloc.h> for alloca? Fixed. 

    Port back to linux... done.

    Back to windows... o_O

TODO







    This code is so messed up in Visual C++, it's probably a good idea to port the networked physics demo there as well.

    People are looking at that code, but very few must be able to run it.

    The code has much more value if you can actually run it and play around!

    






    =======================================
           Reliable Packets over UDP
    =======================================

    Actually hook the example code up to the functions in node and make sure the interface matches what I expect.

    Basically here I want to verify that all reliable packets are received reliably and in order, and to process (throw away)
    the unreliable packets (make sure at least one gets through)

    Need to setup the simulator.

    Need to setup the function to serialize packet.
