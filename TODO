DONE

    Implement the main loop of 004 using the provided interfaces before actually implementing the functions.

    This will let me know if the interfaces make sense or suck.

    At minimum, going to need to adjust how the packet headers are passed in to read aggregate packet, and how read packets
    are returned from that function to caller.

TODO

    Implement write aggregate packet function

    ==================

    Add packet headers to the mix

    Verify packet headers write OK as well.

    ==================

    Update reading and writing packets article with a good reason why big endian is used for network order [x][0][0][0] vs. [0][0][0][x]

    Need to go back over both 001 and 002 examples and add soak modes.

    Soaking is essential to guarantee correct behavior.
