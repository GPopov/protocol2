DONE

TODO

    Cleanup and remove memory initialize and the stupid allocator stuff. There is no need for any of this.

    Remove the queue and data structures I'm not using.

    Incorporate the sliding window and sequence buffer into reliable ordered messages.

    Incorporate the connection packet and connection class into reliable ordered messages. Keep it dependency free. Don't use fancy serialization.
