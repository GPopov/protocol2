DONE

    Create network2.h

    Roughly port across network simulator to network2.h

TODO

    Convert over the network simulator to work from raw packet data and size vs. packet structure

    Implement function to send packet, eg. write it to data and then send it via simulator

    Loop to read packets from simulator. If packet is received, read it and then take the packet
    and work out from packet type how it should be processed, eg. slice packet -> receiver,
    ack packet -> sender.

    Fix bugs in the network simulator causing it to loop forever when receiving packets.

    Put random_int, random_float inside network2.h header. Needed for simulator.

    Implement packet loss.

    Implement latency.

    Implement jitter.

    Implement duplicates.

    ==================

    Add low-level sockets and IPv6 address from GDC 2015 example source code.

    Extend simulator to take address with packet send and receive.

    Update 003 example to have an address for sender and receiver (::1 with different port numbers)

    ==================

    Verify the soak mode runs indefinitely with simulated out of order, packet loss, latency etc.

    Ready to upload to supporters! :D
