    Now that it reproduces with the basically rewritten packet processor, the question is -- can it be reproduced on linux, in a test case?

    Try again, with the actual packet processor sending packets.

    If it reproduces, then the reproduction can be cut down to isolate the problem.

    If it doesn't reproduce, then I still suspect something bad, eg. mem trashing, or queues or something bad trashing memory.

    First try to strip out the sequence stuff and see if that fixes it.

    Eg. make sequence always 0 on both sides for nonce.

    It does not fix it. This makes me think that it's definitely a libsodium bug. I mean, what the fuck could it be?

    There is now absolutely nothing complex going on in my code, and it's still breaking, only on linux.
