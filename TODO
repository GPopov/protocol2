    =======================================
           Reliable Packets over UDP
    =======================================

    Actually hook the example code up to the functions in node and make sure the interface matches what I expect.

    Basically here I want to verify that all reliable packets are received reliably and in order, and to process (throw away)
    the unreliable packets (make sure at least one gets through)

    Need to setup the simulator.

    Need to setup the function to serialize packet.
