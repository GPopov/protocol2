    ==================

    Actually hook the example code up to the functions in node and make sure the interface matches what I expect.

    Basically here I want to verify that all reliable packets are received reliably and in order, and to process (throw away)
    the unreliable packets (make sure at least one gets through)

    Need to setup the simulator.

    Need to setup the function to serialize packet.

    ==================

    Update reading and writing packets article with a good reason why big endian is used for network order [x][0][0][0] vs. [0][0][0][x]

    Make note about copying or at least clearing to zeros after you write a packet so you don't accidentally truncate the packet and not notice.

    Need to go back over both 001 and 002 examples and add soak modes.

    Soaking is essential to guarantee correct behavior.
