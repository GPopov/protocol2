TODO

    Serialize check is still failing for the ack and slice packet read/write. WTF

    ==================

    Implement packet loss.

    Implement latency.

    Implement jitter.

    Implement duplicates.

    ==================

    Verify the soak mode runs indefinitely with simulated out of order, packet loss, latency etc.

    Ready to upload to supporters! :D

    ==================

    Need to go back over both 001 and 002 examples and add soak modes.

    Soaking is essential to guarantee correct behavior.

    ==================
