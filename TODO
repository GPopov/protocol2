    ==================
    
    Need to think about the best interface to get the packet headers in/out of the functions.

    Right now current setup just doesn't work. Need array of pointers to packet headers.

    Alternatively, need to know the stride for the packet headers so we can move forward in memory to the next one from the current pointer.

    Array of pointers to the packet headers seems more *flexible* for the caller, because they can decide how they are laid out in memory.

    Pointer to start of array, and stride of array is the simplest interface to pass in, but a bit naughty.

    ==================

    Add packet headers to the test

    Verify read packet header match written ones (same sequence #)

    Print sequence number out when printing packets that were read.

    Soak the example and make sure it is stable

    ==================

    Update reading and writing packets article with a good reason why big endian is used for network order [x][0][0][0] vs. [0][0][0][x]

    Make note about copying or at least clearing to zeros after you write a packet so you don't accidentally truncate the packet and not notice.

    Need to go back over both 001 and 002 examples and add soak modes.

    Soaking is essential to guarantee correct behavior.
