DONE

    Example code must have a soak mode, eg. set num iterations to -1

    Verify soak runs for a significant time with perfect network conditions.

    Sketched out new interface for network simulator. Previous GDC 2015 network simulator too complicated for what I want to do.

    Added interface for packet loss, duplicates, jitter and latency.

    Sketched out the new network simulator interface.

    Implement a really basic network simulator that works without any packet loss, delay, dupes, etc.

    Cut duplicate packet support.

TODO

    Hook up the simulator with the 003 example.

    Implement packet loss, latency and out of order packets (jitter)
                
    ==================

    Verify the soak mode runs indefinitely with simulated out of order, packet loss, latency etc.

    Ready to upload to supporters! :D
