CHANGES

    Sketched out "ProcessPacket" function

    Hooked up so it gets called. Verified that it correctly distinguishes between fragment and non-fragmented packets.

    Added code to receive packets from packet buffer, vs. reading them directly off the packet write buffer.
    
    Parse the rest of the packet fragment header. Print out the results as procesing each packet, eg. x/y of packet n

    Parse the sequence number out of the regular packet too and print that.

    Pass to the process packet inside the packet buffer.

TODO

    Pass in the single frame packet as a special one fragment packet to packet buffer.
    
    Sequence number is not parsing correctly for non-fragmented packets. Is it getting written correctly?!

    I think there is a difference with what is written through the serialize vs. what is written if I read/write
    manually.

    It seems that I have to go through serialization always.

    --------

    Verify checksum for fragment packet

    --------

    Finish implementing the function to re-assemble and receive packets from the packet buffer.
