    Is it worth adding more unit tests for basic serialization behavior at this point and cleaning up

    Or should I save that for later? Probably later is OK.

    So do I write the sending large blocks article today, or do I write more code?

    What's the pros and cons.

        a) more articles = more support, writing unit tests or more code not likely to create more support

        b) more code does create more *retention*, but retention is pretty good already I think.

    So it seems that the best thing to do right now








    =======================================

    This code is so messed up in Visual C++, it's probably a good idea to port the networked physics demo there as well.

    People are looking at that code, but very few must be able to run it.

    The code has much more value if you can actually run it and play around!

    =======================================
           Reliable Packets over UDP
    =======================================

    Actually hook the example code up to the functions in node and make sure the interface matches what I expect.

    Basically here I want to verify that all reliable packets are received reliably and in order, and to process (throw away)
    the unreliable packets (make sure at least one gets through)

    Need to setup the simulator.

    Need to setup the function to serialize packet.
