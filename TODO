    Sketched out required packets for chunk slice sender/receiver

TODO
    
    Sketch out sender struct

    Sketch out receiver struct

    Setup packet send and receive loop

    Work out what logs I want for the example (eg. sending chunk n, send slice x/y of chunk n, receive slice x/y of chunk n, received chunk n, chunk n was acked )

    Add timer to send packets n per-second for sender if a chunk is being sent

    Add code to mark dirty if a valid slice of the current chunk is recieved

    If dirty, need to send acks for *all* slices of current chunk being received (so need a state, receiving or not receiving current chunk)

    Consider integrating network simulator into the protocol2.h (generally useful?)

    Integrate network simulator into example, because without handling packet loss, out of order, dup etc. this code is not guaranteed to be working
