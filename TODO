DONE

    Seems to be some error in the simulator (eg. after 1024 entries).

    It's not wrapping around properly. Seems to stop receiving packets after it wraps around?

    Was a bug on the delivery time for packets on entries. Fixed.

    Also, there is something weird happening on packet read, it's triggering a read error "???"
    This means an error condition not handled. WTF is going on?!

    I think it's an uninitialized value, eg. a codepath in read packet that is not clearing to zero or setting the error code,
    but is passing it through, uninitialized value.

    Yes. Fixed.

    There is a bug that looks like truncated packets on read. The last serialize check is failing.

    This is the first time that I've actually passed in the bytes written on read? I think?

    If so this could be the source of the error. I'm not doing anything crazy.

    Yes. I was able to simulate this error in the 001 case by actually copying the packet data (memcpy)
    across and clearing the data and copying across just bytes written.

TODO

    So what is the error? Why didn't it initially trigger on 001 example but does now?

    ==================

    Implement packet loss.

    Implement latency.

    Implement jitter.

    Implement duplicates.

    ==================

    Verify the soak mode runs indefinitely with simulated out of order, packet loss, latency etc.

    Ready to upload to supporters! :D
