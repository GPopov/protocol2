DONE

    serialize_check with a uint32_t passed in was annoying.

    Changed it to pass in a string which is hashed, this way you can print out cool stuff like which check failed.

    Which is very helpful for debugging...

    I suspect I need to clear out the memory after the decrypt. It's extra bits getting fed into the bitpacker at the end from encryption!
    
    It genuinely does look like a bug in libsodium such that the packet is having the last byte corrupted.

TODO

    Next goal has to be to isolate this bug in a test harness.
