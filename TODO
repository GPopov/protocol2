DONE

    Cleaned up some scaffolding in the protocol2.h read/write aggregate packet fns.

    Added error handling to WriteAggregatePacket function

TODO

    Add error handling to ReadAggregatePacket function

    ==================
    
    Need to think about the best interface to get the packet headers in/out of the functions.

    Right now current setup just doesn't work.

    ==================

    Add packet headers to the mix

    Verify packet headers write OK as well.

    ==================

    Add soak mode to make sure it is stable

    ==================

    Update reading and writing packets article with a good reason why big endian is used for network order [x][0][0][0] vs. [0][0][0][x]

    Make note about copying or at least clearing to zeros after you write a packet so you don't accidentally truncate the packet and not notice.

    Need to go back over both 001 and 002 examples and add soak modes.

    Soaking is essential to guarantee correct behavior.
