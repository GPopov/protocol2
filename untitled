GOALS

     - I am not performing work for hire and assigning IP to cloud imperium. I am providing consulting services and creating BSD 3.0 open source code.

     - no obligation to do any work for cloud imperium above what is promised (consulting services, 4 hours per-month use it or lose it)

     - no obligation to renew past the initial SOW period (12 months)

     - 4 hours per-month, use it or lose it consulting (does not accrue)

     - lock in rate of $300 per-hour for the consulting above the 4 hours for the 12 month period.

     - need to get the $8k up front. this $8k is to start the agreement (yearly retainer) and is not refundable.
